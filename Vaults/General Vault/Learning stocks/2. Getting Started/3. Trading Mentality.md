Trading is 90% mental
- overcome mental and emotional trading
- the market is never wrong
	- you cant control the market but you can control you
- Mental knowledge is just as important as trading knowledge
- More experience = mentality first
- Less experienced traders think trading knowledge first, mentality second
	- Have a log and analyze what you are feeling before a trade
- fixing mental side of a trade is important before fixing the technical part
	- fearful, greedy, etc.
- **Create a log of emotions in relation to your tech knowledge**
	- you can fix your emotions for that and fix that mistake and act upon it
	- developing a good mental is key for trading
- The market is about handing money from the impatient to the patient 
- Dedicate your self to learn the market and your self

Risk management 
- GREED
	- Being greedy will make you miss out on profit-taking opportunities
	- Require discipline
	- Must be right before profitable
	- Don't ignore the worse case
	- Always focus on how much you can lose not how much you can make
- FEAR
	- Fear of losing money
		- Auto hopping out of trades when its going wrong
		- Can't be afraid to lose
		- Think of the small losses as tuition costs
			- The cost of doing business 
		- Analyze and log what you did wrong
	- fear of missing profits
		- when a trader is making money on a trade they immediately hop out of a trade.
	- fear of missing out
		- Cannot chase a stock without the best entry
		- Do not hop in late on trades
- GREED and FEAR are 2 sides of a coin
	- A balance is needed and that comes from charts, indicators and experience

	![[Pasted image 20250415205924.png]]
- Paper trading doesn't have the same emotion as real money
	- paper trading → prop firm → Real money
	- stress level increase
- Increased heart rate is probably too big of a position or not a back tested strategy 
	- outside your comfort zone

Start small and paper trade
- Start small and increase the size when you are comfortable and gain some confidence
	- over confidence is bad

- Slap props in there too

The reasons for failure
