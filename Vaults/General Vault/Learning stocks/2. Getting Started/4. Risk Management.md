## Why is Risk Management so important?
- Having losses is normal
	- **cost of doing business**
	- **early on is the cost of tuition**
- Create a high probability of survival
- With no risk, there is no reward
- The more risk, the greater the potential reward
- High win rate on trades may not be a good thing without proper risk management
	- big losses with small wins
	- we want big wins with small losses
- 

## Risk to reward ratios
- RR

- With 4 losses and 1 win, we break even
- Anything over that 1 win is profit
- Where to cut the lose if it goes against you

- 1:4 ratio
	- Have to win 4 times and lose once to break eve

- High w/r and rr is best
	- anything over 5:1 is good
- 30% starting out is pretty good

## Cutting losses 
- Okay to be wrong
- Cut small losses according to plan so they dont become bigger
- Cutting out a trade for a loss can be really hard
- Use stop losses and follow your system/plan

## Good RR
