## Rally-Base-Rally (RBR)
- Forms in UPTRENDS
- Always look from the **right to the left** of charts
- Important to find FRESH and UNUSED areas on charts where the price has never been tested before
- Creates massive order imbalance
- Bullish continuation pattern
	- buy pull backs into this imbalance, take profits at supply
- Since market has RALLIED, then BASED, then RALLIED again, the market tends to pullback into the origin area where the imbalance happened to pick up the rest of the orders for another leg higher
- The market **basing** candle is the **origin area** of the demand zone since price rallied, based (paused), and then rallied again
- This basing area **suggests there is a surplus of demand since price was able to rally out of the balanced area**
- Everything else on the chart is just noise
	- the market is balance where market participants are agreeing on price
