- Don't trade just went it reaches a zone
	- wait for a rejection
- If it came to that supply zone but there was enough buyer to break through
	- not enough historic sell orders

- Wait for confirmation
- Higher high for demand

## look at different timeframes
- Higher highs
- Lower lows
- Or long wicks will serve as confirmation
- Technical patterns could also be confirmation
	- double bottom or double top
- If you are trading a 2 hr supply don't look at a 4 hr chart and see if you are making higher highs or lower lows
- For larger time frames move down to smaller time frames to confirm
- Dont get in too early

- Double bottom for confirmation in a demand zone with a bounce
