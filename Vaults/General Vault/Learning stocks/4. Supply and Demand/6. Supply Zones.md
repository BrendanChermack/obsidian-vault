## Supply Zones
1. Identify a basing candle followed by a strong move to the downside
2. Zones starts from the **bottom of the body of the basing** candle **to the top of the wick** (if any)
3. This is our zone
	- only trade after and if the price returns to the originating zone

- Still looking to enter a trade here since the zone is tight
- Wait for the rejection then get in
- Wait for a smaller time zone 
- Higher time frame the down smaller down
- More times the stock enters the zone the more orders it will fill and the greater the chance the zone will not work
	- used up zones

- Bottom of thee basing candle to the top of its wick

## Drop-Base-Drop (DBD)
1. Bearish momentum, price pushed down and creates a short balanced period, bases out, institutions leveraging in their positions here then we get a second drop down
2. Creates supply after base period is where institutions collect orders to fuel the next drop
3. Could enter at the break and put the stop loss above the supply zone or wait for price to come back into the supply area in the future

- The second drop is what qualifies it as a supply zone
