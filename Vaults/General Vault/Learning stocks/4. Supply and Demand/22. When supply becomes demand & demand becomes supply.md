	- price gaps above the supply zone and does not trade inside the zone during reg hrs
- Demand only becomes supply if
	- price gaps below the demand zone and doesnt trade inside during reg hrs

	- when we have a supply but very strong inside of it
	- trade and base out form new demand inside the supply and we can look to take long inside supply on speculation that demand is forming
