## Volume + trapped retail
- Put yourself in their minds where you know they usually are buying a breakout or a breakdown
- Usually the best reversal are where retail traders stop out
- Low of day (LOD) or high of day (HOD)
- This type of confirmation leads to a lower low in demand and a higher high in supply
- For every buyer there is a seller and reverse
- If you see volume surge inside a supply/demand zone and price cannot continue moving in that direction
	- Usually a reversal will happen
	- if price is coming down in a zone and vol is spiking and price cannot go lower absorption is happening

- Green is aggressive buyer hitting the ask
- Red is aggressive seller hitting the bid
- Heavy selling pressure at the last red candle
- Absorption is getting bought by buyers for the big sell off

- Trading right at market open is not a great idea since it is choppy
