## Selling into supply
- Strategy is simple
	- selling short in supply
- We know this supply level formed in the past, historically because of an imbalance in supply>demand
- When price rallies back to that level
	- retail is buying that rally into an area where we know from the chart that are institutions are selling
- At supply zones institutions are selling

	- long in demand
- We know this demand level formed in the past because of imbalance of demand>supply
