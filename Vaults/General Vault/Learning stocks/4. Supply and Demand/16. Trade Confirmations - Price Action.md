## Trade Confirmations
- Price action or supply/demand forming
- Most important thing
	- No one knows when to enter
	- You have to watch price and let it tell you when
	- the zones tell you where
- The key is letting price tell you
- Look for and they all have to do with price and volume
- If price is stalling out at a supply/demand zone go ahead and enter the trade
- Your risk should be very small at that point
- Look for new supply/demand confirmations inside of an existing imbalance
	- take the trade with speculation that a new imbalance may form
	- with experience
- That type of Confirmation comes with experience
	- accepting small losses while winners are much bigger
	- strong mental required
- If you miss the first bounce don't chase the market let the market come to you
