## Drop-Base-Drop
- Creates massive order imbalance
- Forms on downtrends
- Bearish continuation pattern
	- sell on the bounce into this supply
- Market drops then bases then drops
	- second drop confirms there is a supply imbalance at the basing candle
- We wait for the market to rally into the imbalance and we can take a sort for a high probability set up and a stop loss above the supply zone
