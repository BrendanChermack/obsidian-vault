## Supply & Demand Trading
- The force that drives price in any market is an imbalance of supply & demand
- Imbalances can be seen and plotted on the chart
- Low risk / high reward setups
- Trading like an institution
- Must understand the basic laws of supply and demand
- Identifying where they are imbalanced

## **4 Basic Laws of supply & demand**
1. If DEMAND INCREASES and **supply remains the same a shortage** will occur
	- prices go UP
2. If DEMAND DECREASES and **supply remains the same a surplus** will occur
	- prices go DOWN
3. If **demand remains the same** and SUPPLY INCREASES **a surplus** will occur
	- prices go DOWN
4. If **demand remains the same** and SUPPLY DECREASES **a shortage** will occur
	- prices go UP

## How the supply and demand laws relate to Supply & Demand Trading
- Supply = Sellers
- Demand = Buyers
- Imbalanced market = supply > demand or demand > supply
	- Trade here
- When price becomes imbalanced 
	- Price will reverse
	- Supply > demand | prices go DOWN
	- Demand > supply | prices go UP
- Balanced market = consolidation (buyers and seller are equal)
	- market is moving sideways

	- demand zone is green
	- supply zones are red
## Institutions
- Largest forces behind supply and demand
- What are they?
	- Money management and investment firms
	- They have large quantity trades
- Follow in the footsteps of them
- They cant do super big order so they leverage their position
	- small orders get filled overtime
	- eventually all the orders are filled that turns into one big position
- If they were willing to buy 2 mil shares of a 4 mil shares traded average day
	- a huge imbalance would happen
- They leverage their position to buy as many shares at once without moving the market too far from their desired entry
- Then the number of sellers become exhausted so the institutions push the stock higher to attract more sellers
	- we look for this
- Every buyer there is a seller and every seller there is a buyer
- Whatever orders they were not able to complete will be saved until prices return to the area where they were leveraging their position
	- This is how we trade based off supply and demand
	- we wait for price to enter this area where institutions are leveraging their position
