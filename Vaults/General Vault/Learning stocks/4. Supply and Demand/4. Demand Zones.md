## Demand Zones
1. Look to the left of the chart
2. Identify a basing candle followed by a strong move to the upside
3. Zones starts from the **top of the body** of the BASING candle to the **bottom of the wick** if there is one
4. This will be our zone
	- We trade only after and if price returns to the originating zone
	- High probability, low risk high reward
	- wait for bounce and put stop loss below the zone

- Each demand may look different depending on the candle

- Only trade if it returns to the zone

- Orders get quickly absorbed in the demand zone
- For validation, we just need consolidation/base followed by a strong and violent move to the upside
- Higher time frame to smaller ones
- Doesn't matter how long in the past the zone has been sitting there
	- Not applicable to futures?
- Institutions will keep their orders there until price reaches that level
- The key is to identify FRESH zone
	- High probability
	- where the unfilled orders are now sitting
	- 
- Zones that the stock has not reached after it created an imbalance
- More times the stock enters the zone, the more orders it will fill and the greater chance of it breaking out of the zone
	- used up zones

- Used up zone

- Worked the first time clean
	- high probability
- Second time also worked 
	- lower probability trade
- Third test of the demand broke it

## Rally Base Rally
1. Rally upwards, based out, rally again
2. Bullish momentum, price pushed up and creates a short balanced period (in the base), bases, out institutions leveraging in their positions here then the second rally happens
3. Creates demand after base period is where institutions collet order to fuel the next rally
4. Could enter at the break of the base with a stop loss below the consolidation or wait for price to come back into that demand area in the future
