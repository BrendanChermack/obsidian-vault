## Liquidity: 
- How easy it is to buy or sell in the market without affecting its price

| Limit Orders: passive orders                      | Market Orders: aggressive orders              |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Order at a specfifc price or better               | Filled right now, price doesn't matter        |
| Historic orders on the order book (some leftover) | Current orders (Can't be leftover)            |
| Fishing (waiting for it to reach that price)      | Providing liquidity for limit orders          |
| unfilled orders                                   | fish biting the bait (typical retail traders) |

- A lot of historic limit orders get filled in those supply zone
	- the retail buy orders are filling the sell limit orders of the intuitions 
		- not enough eager buyers to push through the sell limit orders

## Market Structure:
- Retail vs. Institutions

| Retail                            | Institutions                   |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Struggling traders                | Make money from retail traders |
| Not as profitable as institutions | Extremely profitable           |
- **To be successful, we have to think and trade like institutions**
- Money is made from the institutions taking it from the retail traders
- Retail traders provide liquidity for intuitions
	- where there is a buyer there is a seller

## Trade like an institution
- Find out where supply/demand imbalances are
- Historic unfilled orders
- Don't think conventionally (buying where you should be seller)
- Always know who is on the other side of your trade
	- who is buy/seller to or from you
- Market vs wholesale prices
- Place orders when institutions are trading
- Profit from these areas by acting and trading like an institution

## Stop thinking conventionally
![[Pasted image 20250417201920.png]]
- Would you buy this stock at this green box? (without knowledge of supply and demand)
	- No price go down
	- no price is making lower lows and lower highs
	- no buying after a crash is bad
	- no they released bad earnings
- What if this was a car
	- yes car on sale
	- yes I can buy wholesale price
		- demand is wholesale price
	- yes it is cheaper than it was
	- yes before the price goes back up

- Retail traders are selling here to fill institution limit orders

![[Pasted image 20250417203120.png]]
- Don't want to buy at market price
	- Want to sell there
	- Buy at wholesale

## why does price change directions
- Price moves from an origin after a supply/demand imbalance
- Once price reaches that imbalance the next time, if there aren't enough buyers or seller to push through all those unfilled (historic) orders
	- price will bounce from that imbalance
- Do not try to predict where an imbalance will star
	- trade once price re-enters this imbalanced zone
- Buy in demand (wholesale)
- Sell in supply (market price)
- Typical retail traders buy at market price(supply) and sell at wholesale(demand)
- Trade like an institution
- When a rally happens typical retail traders don't want to miss out and they buy into areas where institutions are selling
- When the price is dropping retail sells and institutions are buying
- Providing liquidity for large institutions buy or sell orders
- Retails are the fish bait
