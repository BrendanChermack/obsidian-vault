- Trading is very unstructured
	- the market is always throwing different variables at you
	- Dont try to structure something that's unstructured
- Figure out what fits you and your personality the best
- You will have to have your own conviction
	- you have to do your own analysis
	- no one is going to make you money besides you
	- don't rely one someone's validation
- Trust your plan
	- trust your setups and trust your edge
	- this is your structure
- Think out the box + think freely
- You cannot be a good trader by watching/trading for a short period of time
- Success = screentime + experience + losses
- You need to lose and have pain in order to gain
- Journal + review + reflect
