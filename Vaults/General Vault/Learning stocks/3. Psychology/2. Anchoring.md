Anchoring
- The process of remaining focused on what happened in the past and not adapting to the changing market
- What happened in the past doesn't guarantee it will happen 100% of the time again in the future
- Adapting is key for the market since it is always changing
	- (liberation day)
	- avoid becoming stagnant

Avoid Anchoring
- Learning though **experience + screen-time**
	- you will see different thing and patterns
	- you will see common ground
- Record in the trading journal
	- win/losses, identify your mistakes
- Be as objective and flexible as possible
- Evaluate the context of the market regardless of feelings
	- what is volume? Are we failing to break higher or lows? Where is liquidity? What is buyers interest?
- Assess the factors that affecting the market on a day to day basis
- Understand the market is the storyteller
	- traders have to read what the market is telling us
	- we have to comprehend a new chapter of the story everyday
