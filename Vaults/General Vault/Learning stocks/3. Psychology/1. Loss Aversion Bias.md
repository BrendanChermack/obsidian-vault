## AKA: The Fear of losing
- No one wants to lose
- We see a loss as pain
- It is natural to avoid pain → avoid losing
- Traders take more pain with losing than pleasure with winning
- Being emotionally attached to the trade
	- This will affect logical decision making, especially when your money is at stake
1. Instead of closing the trade and cutting the loss, you wait and hold a small losing trade for much longer which then becomes a large losing trade
	- Avoiding pain
	- Not wanting to take a loss, we end up holding a trade and be optimistic it will 
	- follow the plan

	- Plan here was to exit on the first red arrow but it was held and the loss was much greater
2.  Instead of following the plan you trade your P/L instead of the chart and you close out a winning trade for a loss
	- Deviating away from the plan.
	- Turns profit system into a mess
	- **Looking at profit/loss while trading bad, will lead to greed or fear**

	- Saw the profit, then it went to a loss and got out
	- Should have followed the plan
3. Afraid to lose in the first place and don't put a trade on. Even when conditions are perfect
	- With no trades there is no money
	- losing is part of the game

## Avoiding Loss Aversion Bias
1. Trading is an emotional battle: you vs yourself
	- if you let your emotions take over your decision making, your trading performance will suffer
	- It's not you vs the market
2. Losses are a part of trading
	- winners cannot exist without losers
	- you have to lose in order to win
3. When you lose, view it as a win if you followed your plane and if you learned something from it
	- Journaling will help
	- action + reflection = progress
	- if you don't learn from your losses and mistakes no progress will occur
- Once you understand and accept that you will free your emotions of fearing to lose (loss aversion)
- Without execution + risk, trading would not exist
- Losing is a part of the plan
- All you can do is follow the plan and stay patient and disciplined (no emotions involved)
