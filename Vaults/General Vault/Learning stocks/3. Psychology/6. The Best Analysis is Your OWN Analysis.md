- People chase alerts or look for someone to tell them when to buy/sell
	- trading doesn't work like that
- Consistency will not come from following other people's alerts or signals
- Stop looking for the easy way out
- Do your homework. Do your research. Do your own analysis.
- You can use others analysis to add to your own twist or strategy/plan behind it
