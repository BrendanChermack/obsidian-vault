- Many traders are attracted to making the big money
- Money and profits are a product of trading well and following your process/analysis
- Stop setting "profit goals"
	- you will not be setting the bar high enough
	- limiting your self
	- if you don't meet the goal, it will effect your next trades
- Follow the process, follow the plan, the profits will follow
- Stop chasing profits first
- Chase the improvement everyday. Mentally and physically
