- Bull Market: **stock going up**
	- prolonged period of increasing stock prices, BULLISH.
- Bear Market: **stock going down**
	- Period of stock prices declining, BEARISH.
- just because we are in a bull market doesn't mean we can't have a short bear period

## Going Long:
- if I am long a stock i want the stock to go up
- buy low - sell high

## Bid vs Ask and spread I:
- **Bid**
	- price you will pay to sell a stock to a buyer
		- lowest price a buyer is willing to pay for a stock
	- if i were to sell a stock it goes to a stock and that is the lowest price they are willing to buy
	- ex buy 10 shares on the ask and sell right away sell goes to the bid
- **Ask**
	- Price you will pay to buy a stock from a seller
		- highest price a seller is willing to sell their stock
- **Spread**
	- the difference between the lowest ASK and highest Bid
		- **ASK-BID = SPREAD**
- Market order vs limit order
	- market order:
		- simple and quickest way to fulfil an order (buy or sell)
			- purchasing stocks
		- when buying
			- your order will get executed immediately at the current ask price (highest price a seller is willing to sell a stock)
		- when selling
			- your order gets executed immediately at the current BID price (the lowest price a buyer is will to pay for the stock)
		- Doesn't guarantee the cheapest price
		- Avoid using on securities that have low volume (low liquidity)
			- securities: stocks, bonds, etc. investment stuff
		- Can use on securities that are highly liquid
			- recommended
	- Limit orders: (fishing order)
		- gives you control over entry and exit price
		- lets you set the max and min price that you are will to buy or sell
			- ex. if you want to buy at a stock at 20 dollars, you can set a limit order to buy at $20 and you will not pay over exactly $20 and you may get filled for even cheaper than $20
		- execution may not happen
			- someone may not want to buy at $20
			- not being able to sell? since there is no buyer that wants that price?
		- can be used on stocks with low liquidity 
			- wont lose with wide spreads on the bid/ask
## stop loss orders:
- SELL order that will only execute if the price of the stock reaches the target price or lower
- designed to limit you lose on a position
- sets a price trigger that automatically sells once a set price is reached
- protection from losses
![[obsidian-vault/Vaults/Course Notes/Learning stocks/media/Pasted image 20250408075410.png]]
- Ex. if you bought a stock at $100 and its trading $105 right now. You could set a stop loss order at $102. This will mean when the price starts to go down and hits $102 the order becomes an order to sell. if it does sell a $2 profit was made.
	- don't have to be looking at it
	- stop losses aren't guaranteed?
## Bid vs Ask II:
- Bid:
	- Max price the buyer is willing to pay
- Ask 
	- min price the seller is willing to receive
- Users:
	- Sellers use the bid rate
	- buyers use the ask rate
- Ex. 
	- There are 3 traders Austin, James and Brandon. Austin and James currently own a stock and Brandon is looking to buy that stock
	- Austin is willing to sell his share at $104.50 and Brandon is willing to buy at that price or better (meaning 104.50 or less). This will happen since Austin is selling on the ASK and Brandon is willing to buy for that ASKING price of $104.50
	- Austin now has no shares left and thinks the stock will go up today. So he puts a LIMIT order to BUY at the BID(max price the buyer is willing to pay) price. Austin will buy his share from someone who is selling the stock. James who is looking to sell will sell to Austin on the bid

## What is the priority on the trade?

| Price                                               | Shares                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| I want to pay no more than x dollars for this stock | I want to buy or sell all my shares right now |
| Limit order                                         | Market order                                  |
IMPORTANT (probably)
**Every market order (aggressive) will get filled to a limit order (passive)**
