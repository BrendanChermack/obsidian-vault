Chart Patterns
- Charts patterns put buying/selling into perspective by consolidating the forces of supply and demand into a picture
- Chart patterns give a access to analyze the war of buying and selling
- Patterns can be used to make short term or long term forecasts
- patterns that worked in the past that can work in the future
	- just guidelines and we can wait for retests for confirmation

Double top reversal
	![[{8D37F2FD-B28E-41FB-B796-0E45CE3A29A1}.png]]
	- Double top is a bearish reversal pattern
	- this pattern can be seen in all time frames
	- the 2 peaks must be close or equal in price
	- volume usually decreases on the second top
		- buys arent willing to buy that price anymore
	![[{FB366247-71A8-4B90-89E7-99E3F426F628}.png]]
	- The second top wasn't able to break the first tops high signaling a string sign a reversal is going to occur because it is telling us that buying pressure is decreasing
	- We can also put our stop lose above the top 
		- low risk high reward
		- doesn't have to be exactly the same heights
Double bottom reversal
- this is a bullish reversal
- The price drops to a support level before rallying back up and then falling to the support level again before a new uptrend
- Volume usually increases on both bottoms to confirm support
- can use the second bottom as an entry to buy a long
- stop loss can be below the support point
	- 1st or second bottom
	![[{1E0EAC37-2E0D-4399-AF0C-C2AF727B9186}.png]]
- volume is key
	 ![[{6EB5A9AF-378C-47D7-B1F3-493326BF0ECF}.png]]
- selling pressure is about finished and a reversal can ocur
	![[{510EB0DD-11C6-4AF4-AF09-84260FCC0B22}.png]]
- We can buy at the circle with the long green candle as a confirmation of a uptrend
- and put the stop loss at the bottom of the second low
- or the 1st low

Triple top/bottom
- same as double top/bot but with price tests the support /resistance 3 times instead of 2
- VOLUME IS VERY IMPORTANT WITH THESE PATTERNS
	![[{3013155E-5FA1-4FB9-83C6-5BCD4F90F70E}.png]]
 - After many tests the likely hood of a break is high
 - We could enter a long after the 3rd bounce in that long green candle with out stop loss below the 3rd bottom
 - for the triple top we can short after the 3rd top in that long red candle with stop loss above the 3rd top
Head and shoulders 
- Bearish reversal pattern that most reliable when found in an uptrend
- while in an uptrend the market begins to weaken and the war of supply and demand are mostly in balance
- resembles a baseline with three peaks
	![[{92F41319-F146-44A9-A2E5-673770FDE504}.png]]
- The two are close in height and the middle is the greatest
	![[{94766181-60D3-468C-859D-8F0BFA6B1BDD}.png]]
- Volume should increase on the break below the neckline following the right should to confirm a reversal

Inverse head and shoulders
- Bullish reversal pattern
- most likely in a downtrend
- traders typically enter into a position when the price rises above the neckline resistance
	![[{F23E9D46-9FA9-46DD-ADA2-0D729D5D7A6A}.png]]
-  bullish signal
- Possible a start of a bull market
	![[{0E8C8D53-8BB7-4BA4-AFDB-3D1526F751A8}.png]]
- In order to confirm a bullish reversal the volume should increase on the break above the neckline
- volume to confirm it

Rising wedge
	![[{E3CADBDA-82DA-4DAF-98CE-239E651550E3}.png]]
	- Bearish reversal pattern
	- starts out wide at the bottom and contracts as prices move higher and the trading range narrows
	- Both trend lines should be positive slopes
	- As the Trend lines get closer to convergence a sell-off initiate which collapses the price through the lower trend line
	- collapse the price through the lower trend line
	- consolidating smaller and smaller
	- the series of higher highs and higher lows may seem bullish
	- the final break below support indicates that the forces of supply outweighed demand and lower prices are likely
		![[{E42712CF-9728-4108-9B14-E9CF4E6BE47D}.png]]
	 - a risky entry could be right below the break of the lower trend line
	 - You could get in on the latest higher low and the stop above the consolidation phase
	 - **Always have an exit plan before you enter**
		 ![[{B1E119C3-92EA-4CC2-9FC4-CBEA81587930}.png]]

Falling wedge
- bullish pattern that begins wide at the top and contracts as prices move lower
- Both trend lines should have a negative slope
- as the trend lines get closer to convergence
	- demand outweighs the supply which allows the price to break above the upper trend line resistance
	- volume should increase on the breakout to confirm a reversal
		![[{97F8812E-23A8-495E-A926-0536B8E53F2C}.png]]
- series of lower lows and lower highs may seem bearish
- the final break above the resisatance indicates that the forces of demand have outweighed supply 
	- rising the prices are likely
- wait for confirmation before entering into a position
	![[{F5F2C281-CA77-45CC-9202-18BDCF3B97FA} 1.png]]

	![[{7AA861E4-D2A1-41C9-8D67-FD90AECD1606}.png]]
	- Short term continuation patterns
	- flag and pennants are usually easy to ID 
	- These patterns usually start with a strong bullish candle with heavy volume which forms the flag pole
	- Squeeze play
		- for pennants

	- for pennants
		- in between bullish and bearish
