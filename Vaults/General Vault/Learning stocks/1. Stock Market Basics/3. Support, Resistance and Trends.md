Supply/Demand Determining Stock Price
- War between buyers and sellers
- **More people buy = stock prices rise (demand)**
	- As buyers step into the market
		- **demand > supply = price goes up**
		- ex. large demand with not a lot of supply
			- rare car only one so the price goes up
			- no one has it so the price goes up for it
- **More people selling = stock prices fall (supply)**
	- supply > demand
		- **people holding stocks sell and stock price does down**
		- pay pretty cheap for it since there is a lot of it
		- anyone can get it so its not expensive
- there is always a buyer but it is how aggressive they are
- Consolidation
	- supply = demand
		- balanced
		- sideways price action

support and resistance
- price levels that tend to act as barriers preventing the asset from getting pushed in a certain direction
- resistance is the ceiling and support is the floor
- when one of them is broke the broken becomes either a new resistances or new support depending where it breaks
- when resistance happens supply > demand
- support happens when demand > supply

	- downtrend 
		- lower highs and lower lows
		- remains lower until the prices closes above a prior high in the downtrend
		- more it has been tested the more significant it becomes
		- a breakout above the down trend line usually signals a reversal of the downtrend
