## Technical Indicator
- Indicators give you useful information about price dynamics
- they are based on math eq that produce a value that is then plotted on the chart
- can help predict the future movement of a stock
- there are tons of indicators out there that measure tons of stuff
- majority of indicators are lagging, only moving after price does
- too many can be bad
	- then bad trades

## Moving averages
- most common
- **moving average is the average price for a stock over a time period that helps smooth out the price action for trend identification**
- used to find trends and confirm reversals
- helps us get a sense of realistic future price point
- Moving averages are a lagging indicator
- **SMA (Simple Moving Average)**
	- calcs the average price of data
- **EMA (Exponential Moving Average)**
	- Gives more weight to current data which reduces lag
	- react more quickly to recent price changes

## What moving averages do we use?
- SMA
	- 5 SMA: good for short term movement
	- 10 SMA: last stop for short term movement
	- 50 SMA: mid-term trends
	- 200 SMA: Long term trends
- EMA:
	- **9 EMA: great for short term movement**
		- USEFUL
		- Possible exit indicator

## Moving average time frames
- Certain moving averages work better than others for different time frames
- **9 EMA works best for  the 3 to 5 min time frame**
	- most applicable 
- 5 to 10 SMA works best for hourly time frame
- 50 to 200 SMA works best for the daily time frame
- Not a sole reliable
	- use chart patterns, price action and volume

## Moving average crossovers
- Bullish(green)
	- **short term moving averages** crosses **above** **long term** moving averages to the upside
	- Golden cross
		- another name for it
			![[{2A8881B5-55FC-4FEA-B9B9-907AE2705E48}.png]]
		- blue crossed over the orange
	- 5 sma crosses above 10 sma on hourly chart
	- 50 crosses above 200 sma on daily chart
- Bearish(red)
	- **short term** **moving average** crosses **below** **long term** moving average to the downside
	- deadly cross
		- another name for it
	- 5 sma crosses below 10 sma on hourly chart
	- 50 sma crosses below 200 sma on daily chart
		![[{021EBDAA-97DC-4C94-9ADF-7458BE91246D}.png]]
	- Deadly cross
- ![[{0018AED3-0F64-49CF-BF9F-DB5A68500857}.png]]
	- deadly cross followed by a golden cross
- ![[{CA712631-4E94-438A-8ADF-DCBF8406EAE8}.png]]
	- shorter term
	- when 5 crosses below the 10 we get bearish movement
	- when 5 crosses above the 10 we get a bullish movement
- The cross movement isnt always gonna happen

## how do moving averages help us
- ID trends
- confirm reversals
- acts as support and resistance
- great tools for applying stop losses and profit taking areas

## 9 EMA
- Identify strong trends and possible reversals
- acts as support and resistance
- above = bullish
- below = bearish
- will help ride trends on 5 min chart
- helps with entries or areas to take profits
	![[{05AB3E8D-0FB7-4008-81FA-9FA1E652127D}.png]]
- we can hold it until it CLOSES below the 9EMA
- ride the trend
- take profit or scale out
	- sell half of the position and hold the rest
	- and sell when 9EMA confirms a reversal
	![[{EDFCE25B-8E24-468B-A24C-60C55B8B746E}.png]]
		9EMA is acting as support
- the reverse is also true for a bearish movement
- only use when it is proven

## VWAP
- The volume weighted average price (VWAP) goated intraday tech indicator
- Helps gauge where to buy/sell
- if stock is trading above VWAP it is said to be bullish
- if below it is bearish
- Does not large
- can act as support and resistance
- great for trend confirmation
- only use middle VWAP
- can be used with 9EMA for golden/deadly cross

		Deadly cross

		golden cross

		Bearish

		1 min chart 
- Check if we open above or below VWAP for the day
- good risk to reward

## Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
- momentum and trend following indicator that is based on info of moving averages
- MACD line is calculated by subtracting the 26 day EMA from the 12 day EMA
- A 9 day EMA of the MACD is plotted which is called "signal line"
- when the MACD cross above the 9EMA it is bullish
- when it crosses below the 9 EMA it is bearish
- best for on the daily chart (long term) because it lags

## MACD Divergence
- when MACD forms high or lows that diverges from the corresponding highs and lows on the price
	![[{FEE04A43-76F3-49CB-9018-BED44AFD4B23}.png]]
		- Made MACD higher low and price made a lower low
		- price can increase after this
		- bullish
	-Bearish divergence
		![[{C16F2953-FBA9-4E1F-A3FA-58450E3E0971}.png]]
		- MACD is making lower highs but prices are making higher highs
		- price decreases in the future

## Relative Strength Index (RSI)
- measures the speed and change of price movements which indicate overbought and oversold levels
- traders use the RSI as a confirming indicator while they use other indicators to obtain a buy/sell signal
- when RSI is at or above 70% level the stock is considered overbought
- when RSI is at or below 30% level the stock is considered oversold
- when trend are strong stocks can remain over bought or oversold for long periods
	![[{CC4823B0-F262-4B90-8AA4-A0E0509EB008}.png]]
- MACD + RSI
	![[{FFA9C2F9-B0A9-42BC-A59E-8A3F08E3FEE5}.png]]
	- more longer term
## Main indicators for intraday
- VWAP and 9 EMA
