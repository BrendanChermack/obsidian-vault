## Indicators to use is the strat. 
- Volume Profile
- OrderFlow Co-pilot and Orderflow foot print chart
## Prep work - Identify high volume areas in a Gaussian Distribution
- First we identify where high volume areas are.
- After they are identified we also know low volume nodes, which are above and below high volume areas
Example 1:

## The Setup
- We can either look for a rebound or a continuation play, targeting 2r for now. 
- Rebound
	- On a rebound play we can take either the top of bottom of the high volume area and target POC most likely. 
	- It can be possible to take a whole move to the other side however the win rate will probably be lower.
	- How do we determine a rebound
		- ORDERFLOW
			Example: 
			![[Pasted image 20260220200438.png]]
		- The price above the value area (blue rectangle) is absorbed. The can be determined manually OR with OFC 
- Continuation 
	- MORE TESTING REQUIRED
## Execution

TDU supply zone is 1 tick below the stop
- Entry at low volume node level with risk above a HH or supply zone within reason to get 2r
