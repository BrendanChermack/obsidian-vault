- throughput is the number of operations over a given time
	- number of requests a server can handle
	- stress test
- availability
	- percentage of time the server is available 
- SLA
	- service level agree - percentage of uptime

Next assignment use the integration testing doc provided

MongoDB
- geospatial queries
	- location-based data
- use case
	- nearby locations
	- mapping and GIS
	- asset tracking
		- monitor real-time location of assets
	- point data
		- lat and long
		- multiple points - polygon
		- finding nearby starbucks
			- save in db and query to find it
	- geo-JSON
		- encoding geographical data structure
		- points, line string, polygons
		- https://eric.clst.org/tech/usgeojson
		- https://geojson.tools/ Visual tester 
- Geospatial queries in mongodb
	- indexes can be made

	- and u can find a restaurant within those coordinates
- MongoDB finish up

- Networking
	- bullions of connected commputing devices
		- hosts = end systems
		- running network apps at the internet's edge
	- packet switches
		- forward packets
			- routers and switches
	- communications links
		- fiber
		- transmission rate: bandwidth
	- networks
		- collection of devices, routers, links
			- managed by an org
	- internet is a network of networks
		- interconnected isps
	- routing between routers
	- protocols
		- control sending, receiving of messages
		- ex: HTTP, TCP. WIFI, etc.
	- internet standards
		- RFC: request for comments
		- IEFT: Internet Engineering Task Force
	- Infrastructure
		- provides services to applications
	- provides programming interface to distributed applications
		- service 1 and service 2
		- service 2 needs something from service 1
		- we need to know the requirements for the service 2 interface
		- the interface is needed to get the information
	- Protocols
		- rules for sending requests
		- ex:
			- TCP connection request
			- response
			- get request
			- sends file
	- internet protocol stack
		- applications layer
			- supporting network apps
				- http
		- transport layer
			- tcp udp
		- network layer
			- routing of datagrams
		- link
			- data trans
		- physical layer
	- services, layering and encapsulation
		- 5 or 7 layers
		- osi model
			- yt video
	- gateway connects 2 networks
	- firewall filters traffic
		- permits or blocks packets
	- proxy
		- a gateway that manages traffic on your behalf 
		- hide your IP
	- Common misunderstandings (common sense)
		- Network reliability
		- latency is zero
		- bandwidth is infinite
		- network is secure
		- technology doesn't change
		- one admin
		- transport cost is zero
		- The network is homogeneous
	- 32 bit identifier
		- 8 bit per octet 
		  - 8 bits of binary per octet
			- 192 = 11000000
			- 168 = 10101000
			- etc
	- each interface has an IP address
		- connection between host/router and physical link
	- interfaces like type c, rj-45
	- interface limitations
		- speeds on router not giving full speed
	- How do we get an IP address?
		- how does a host get an IP
			- hardcoded
			- manually assigned
			- 0 and 255 are reserved so 254 are free to use
		- how does a network get an IP 
	- DHCP
		- dynamic host config protocol: dynamically get address from as server
- DHCP:
	- renew its lease on address in use
	- allows the reuse of IP addresses
	- support mobile users who join/leave
	- DHCP is inside the router
	- ![[{D2FBE38A-21B7-42D9-A198-93416684EEF6}.png]]
	- 255.255.255.255 is a broadcast message
	- sent to all devices
	- new IP address is sent and needs to be accepted
		- ack
- every device has an Ip address
- ICANN
	- responsible for assigning IP addresses
	- allocated the large blocks of addresses
	- ISP allocated IP addresses too
- IP addresses
	- public IP 
		-IP that can be accessed anywhere on the internet
	- private IP
		- restricted to local network
		- localhost
		- 127.0.0.1
	- static 
		- unchanging IP
	- dynamic DHCP



- DORA
	- DevOps Research and Assessment
	- lead time for changes
		- time between committing code changes to the trunk branch and when it is in a deployable state
		- main branch 
			- branch that is deployed
	- Change failure rate
		- percentage of code changes that require hot fixes
		- This does not measure failures during testing and fixed
	- Deployment freq
		- number of deployments into prod per unit time
		- amazon has thousands of deployments per day
	- mean time to recovery
		- how long it takes to recover from a partial service interruption or total failure

DOCKER
- nothing new

REDIS
- All data stored in RAM
- key value pairs, cache, msg broker
- use cases
	- Caching
	- real-time analytics
	- session store
		- stores session data
	- msg queues 
		- msg broker for building scalable and distributed systems
- docker install for it

Deployment
- traceability
	- track all elements of a service in prod
	- code and deps
- repeatability
	- the same actions with the same artifacts you get the same result
	- Ex: test cases 
	- problem when building a new version could be fetched
	- could cause tests to fail
	- db tests are harder 
- flaky tests
	- no repeatable tests 
	- multi thread test
		- one changes data the other reads the data
	- logs when testing
- security
	- 15-20% breaches are caused by insiders
	- ways to prevent
		- limit pipeline access
		- keep record of changes and the originator 
		- notifications when the pipeline has been updated/modded
- Envs
	- place to performs tests, write code
	- isolated from prod
	- req
	- elements
		- machine or machines or vms
			- containers
		- infra structures
			- ex load balancers
		- input source for tests
		- db
		- config parameters
		- external services
- collection of virtual machines or containers
	- dev single module is tested
		- unit test
	- integration is service is tested
		- whole thing
	- staging
		- service plus other services
- source of input
	- test harness
		- prepare the env to run the test
		- jest
	- dynamic workload generator
		- sql or python script to add a bunch of data
	- replaying a previously captured input from live users
		- mimic live user to generate more test data
	- from live users
- db
	- restored after each test
	- to make tests work
- env lifecycle
	- create an env
	- used 
	- cleaned up
	- creation and clean up can be automated
	-
