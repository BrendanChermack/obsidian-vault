**Week 1**
Geography:
- Study of the areal differentiation of the earth surface, as shown in the character, arrangement, and inter-relations over the earth of elements such as climate, relief, soil, vegetation, population, land use, industries, or states, and of the unit areas formed by the complex of these individual elements -- American College Dictionary
- Tells what is where, why, and what of it -- Isaiah Bowman
Culture:
- Learned collective human behavior, as opposed to instinctive or inborn, behavior
- These learned traits form a way of life held in common by a group of people
	- A Human Geography textbook
- It is a very complex assemblage of items, taken together, may be as important a variable as any in explaining the behavior of individuals or societies or the mappable patterns of activities and man-made objects upon the face of the earth -- Wilbur Zelinsky (The Cultural Geography of The United States 1992: 68)
- Culture is a “signifying system Through which a social order Is communicated, reproduced,  Experienced, and explored” (Raymond Williams, The Sociology of Culture, 1982:  13).
- . . . A shared set of meanings that are lived Through the material and symbolic practices of Everyday life.”  —Paul Knox & Sallie Marston
- What is culture?
	- Culture is one of the most complex terms in the English Language (Mike Crang, after Raymond Williams 1982 Keywords)
	- Culture can be ‘folk’ (traditional), ‘popular’ (mass) or elite culture
	- Culture is a way of life, a belief system
	- Culture has material and symbolic forms
	- Culture is ordinary: part of our taken-for-granted world (Raymond Williams)
	- Culture(s) can be mapped
	- Culture is contested: “culture wars”
	- Culture informs how we think about the world
Cultural Geography
- A very broad subdiscipline:
	- human mods of the earth's surface
		- Landscapes
	- Spatial patterns of different culture groups and traits
	- Use spaces and environments by different sub-cultural groups
		- Meaning ascribed to an derived from blades and spaces: houses, neighborhoods, cities, landscapes, regions, nations
			- Identities: urban-rural; regional; national; ethnic/racial; gender/sexuality
	- Geographies of cultural products
		- things we make
			- burgers, houses, etc.	
**Week 2**
Culture Regions:
- Defined as a contiguous and bounded grouping of places according to certain sets of criteria
- Culture regions can be mapped
- Culture regions tend to overemphasize differences between places which in reality are 'blurred' 
- Because every place is implicitly unique the concept of the region is a geographical tool a way of simplifying complex spatial patterns
- Three types of culture regions
	- formal
	- functional
	- vernacular
- An area inhabited by people with one or more identifiable trait in common
- Describes spatial differences and commonalities of economic activity and social and cultural traits
A. Formal regions
- An area inhabited by people with one or more identifiable traits in common
- Describes spatial differences and commonalities of economic activity and social and cultural traits
- Recognition of multiple traits or characteristics complicates mapping of formal regions
B. Functional culture regions
- An area organized as a political, economic or social unit to perform a specific function
	- has nodes - centers of activity
	- clearly defined borders and boundaries
	- boundaries may be fixed or variable
	- rarely coincide exactly with formal regions
C. Vernacular Culture Regions
- An area perceived to exist by local inhabitants
	- mental maps
- May be based on environmental, economic, political or historical features
- Often maintained through the media
	- local news, regional literature, sports teams
		- sports conferences
- Often lack the organization of functional regions & more complex than formal regions
Folk culture and folk cultural regions
- Many formal and vernacular regions (mental maps) are formed using the characteristics or features of folk culture
- What distinguishes folk culture from popular culture?
- What regional patterns did various folk vultures create in the US?
- What threatens these cultures, 'ways of life'?
- Folk Culture
	- a rural, cohesive, conservative, self-sufficient group that is homogeneous in custom and race, with a strong family or clan structure and highly developed rituals
- Characteristics
	- tradition rules: religion and family
	- little division of labor
	- goods are handmade
	- economy is subsistence
	- individualism is weak
- Mapping folk culture
	- material folk culture can be mapped
		- tangible items, objects, 'things'
		- delimit regions (core, domain and sphere)
		- trace diffusion or retreat of material folk culture across space and time
- Pennsylvania forebay barn
	- very large red
	- originated in Switzerland
	- seen throughout central and eastern PA
- Western plains 'beef wheel' windlass device
	- used for butchering cattle
	- crude type of crane
- Pentanque in Quebec
	- type of bowling game


SUMARRY OF JOHN, "GEOGRAPHY AND CULTURE: AN INVITATION TO EXPLORE"
The text introduces geography as a broad and dynamic field, not just about maps or capitals. Geography studies both physical systems (like climate, soils, and landforms) and human systems (like population, culture, and land use). It asks not only _where_ things are but also _why_ they are there and _what it means_. Geography uses both quantitative tools (like census data and mapping) and qualitative methods (like interviews and cultural interpretation) to analyze the world.

Cultural geography is presented as a subfield of human geography. It examines how people shape and give meaning to places through behaviors, objects, and ideas. This includes landscapes, cultural products, identities, and everyday practices. Early traditions like environmental determinism argued that environment dictated culture, but Carl Sauer and the Berkeley School challenged this by focusing on culture as an agent shaping landscapes. Later, scholars such as Wilbur Zelinsky emphasized artifacts, sociofacts, and mentifacts as elements of culture, while others critiqued his “superorganic” idea of culture as existing beyond individuals.

The “new cultural geography” shifted focus toward culture as a system of meanings, shaped by power, politics, and discourse. Thinkers like Raymond Williams influenced this approach, viewing culture as a signifying system embedded in social, political, and economic life. This broadened cultural geography to study not just material traits but also media, representation, and identity, while acknowledging culture as contested and plural.

Overall, the text shows cultural geography as an evolving field that bridges physical space and human meaning. It embraces culture as a complex, multifaceted idea—sometimes understood as traits, practices, or objects, and sometimes as systems of meaning—while highlighting how culture and geography together shape the world we live in

**Week 3**
- Mapping cultural change
	- cultures are dynamic, ever-changing
		- spatially (across the earth's surface)
		- temporally (through time)
	- spatially and temporally evolving cultures create distinctive regions/landscapes
	- cultural diffusion
		- concept to theorize and map cultural change
	- the spread of ideas, innovations and cultural attitudes, way of life (culture)
	- diffusion isn't simply random but conforms to patterns
		- physical geography: rivers, mountains, passes, lakes, soils, climate
		- technologies of mobility/transportation also determine channels of diffusion
	- two main types of diffusion: relocation and expansion (contagious and hierarchical)
	- ![[Pasted image 20250910071539.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20250910071547.png]]
- Diffusion of folk cultures
	- regions project outward from source areas: know as cultural hearths
	- diffusion tends to be contagious expansion diffusion, though relocation diffusion can create new cultural hearths, e.g. Mormon Utah or Oregon overlanders
	- prevalence of absorbing and permeable barriers: e.g., physical terrain, political boundaries
	- material culture a key to folk diffusion
- Diffusion (relocation and contagious expansion) has created traditional folk culture regions across the US
	- ![[Pasted image 20250910071925.png]]
- Houses, field system and agricultural buildings (fences and barns), churches and even language and place names are mappable objects indicative of different folk cultures
- Relocation diffusion
	- ![[Pasted image 20250910072046.png]]
- Examples of folk diffusion
	- agricultural fairs from Yankee region in 1810 across the heartland and Midwest
		- national by 1912
		- good example of contagious expansion diffusion
- ![[Pasted image 20250910072218.png]]
- Diffusion of popular culture
	- stages of diffusion
		- 1. Acceptance of idea or innovation
		- 2. 'neighborhood effect': rapid growth, contagious diffusion (creates cultural core)
		- 3. Slower, sustained growth, hierarchical diffusion
	- impediments to diffusion
		- 1. Time-distance decay effect (folk culture, or during 'neighborhood effect')
		- 2. Absorbing barriers: unusual
		- 3. Permeable barriers: filters
- The diffusion of hip-hop culture
	- originated as an inner city, black, youth-oriented culture (hip-hop nation) in late 70s
		- graffiti, music, fashion, dancing, language, personalities
	- carney (2003) identifies 3 main culture cores of rap music
		- east coast
		- west coast
		- south coast
			- miami, new orleans, houston, atlanta, memphis
	- diffusion of rap music was rapid
		- suburban/widwestern
			- beastie
			- eminem
			- kid rock
	- internal
		- MC Solaar
		- Duran Duran tribute to public enemy 
	- global rap
		- hybrid sounds
			- traditional(regional) and modern(popular)
			- social themes: such poverty, racism, migrant crisis
		- rap as an evolving cultural geography
