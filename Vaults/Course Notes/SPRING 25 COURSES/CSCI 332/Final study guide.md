which will consist of essay questions which cover the following course learning outcomes:

- Students articulate how applicable codes of ethics (the ACM code) relate to them and other stakeholders
	- The ACM Code of Ethics consists of 24 imperatives organized into general moral imperatives, specific professional responsibilities, organizational leadership imperatives, and compliance requirements. As emerging computing professionals, students should see themselves as obligated by imperatives such as “Contribute to society and human well-being” and “Avoid harm to others” in all design and development activities ​. These principles apply not only to their own actions but also frame expectations for how stakeholders—clients, users, employers, and the public—are treated, ensuring that privacy, fairness, and respect for intellectual property are upheld. By internalizing the Code, students learn to identify and balance the competing interests and rights of all parties affected by computing systems.
- Students can cogently discuss core concepts in computing ethics (Baase 1.4 related)
	- Ethics is defined as the study of what it means to “do the right thing,” encompassing theories such as utilitarianism, deontological duties, and virtue ethics that guide rational, free choice . Baase distinguishes ethics from law and policy, emphasizing that ethical reflection must fill gaps before formal regulations exist or when laws lag behind technological advances. Key concepts include assessing consequences of actions, respecting individual autonomy, and applying universal principles rather than case-by-case whims. Understanding these foundational ideas equips students to navigate dilemmas like privacy versus security or freedom of expression versus harm.
- Recognize professional responsibilities and make informed judgments in computing practice based on legal and ethical principles (Computer Science _Program_ outcome)
	- In professional practice, computing practitioners must maintain competence, know and respect relevant laws, and engage in rigorous, honest evaluation of systems and risks . The SE and ACM Codes stress duties such as providing full disclosure of limitations, protecting confidentiality, and “blowing the whistle” when serious dangers are ignored. Students learn to balance ethical imperatives against legal requirements, accepting personal accountability for decisions that affect health, safety, and welfare. This framework enables informed judgments that honor both ethical principles and legal obligations in real-world computing scenarios.

An essay question will also ask you what your professional responsibilities are, if any, prior to external whistleblowing (notifying an external entity of a concern, usually safety, in your organization). {See Baase 9.3.9 & [Guidelines for Engineers Dissenting on Ethical Grounds}](https://web.archive.org/web/20150920014300/http://www.onlineethics.org/Resources/ethcodes/EnglishCodes/IEEEguidelines.aspx)
- Before resorting to external whistleblowing, a computing professional has an ethical obligation to raise safety or design concerns internally—first by discussing the issue with the project manager and then, if necessary, taking it to higher‐level authorities within the organization . IEEE guidance similarly urges engineers to “try to catch problems early and keep the argument at the lowest managerial level possible” and to “use organizational dispute resolution mechanisms” before going outside the company [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20150920014300/http%3A//www.onlineethics.org/Resources/ethcodes/EnglishCodes/IEEEguidelines.aspx). Professionals should establish a clear technical foundation for their concerns, maintain an objective, impersonal tone, and keep thorough records of all communications and evidence [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20150920014300/http%3A//www.onlineethics.org/Resources/ethcodes/EnglishCodes/IEEEguidelines.aspx). Only after these internal avenues are exhausted—and when one is confident in the technical assessment and the severity of the risk—should external reporting be considered, so as to avoid misguided or harmful disclosures
I will also ask you two HFOSS related questions:  
(_On our class Web page, follow the links under the heading_: Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software (HFOSS))
https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/open-source-good-how-can-it-do-good
- What existing HFOSS project would you most want to contribute to?  Why?
	- https://github.com/996icu/996.ICU
	- it would be good to reduce china's intensive work schedules and keep them healthy
- What humanitarian/social need isn't being addressed by a current HFOSS project, but you believe should be?
	- A public API for emergency services with a standard to increase their outreach to people in emergencies
	-
